this is a program for finding the calendar of a particular year you wanna see...
A calendar made in C is a simple computer program that provides basic functionality to display and navigate through dates, months, and years. It typically utilizes the C programming language to handle date-related calculations and user interactions. The calendar program allows users to input a specific year, and then it generates and displays a calendar for that year.

The core functionality of the C calendar program may include:

1. Input handling: The program takes user input to specify the year for which the calendar needs to be displayed.

2. Date calculations: Using standard C date and time functions, the program determines the day of the week for the first day of the specified year and then populates the calendar accordingly.

3. Calendar display: The program prints a neatly formatted calendar to the console or terminal, showing each month with its corresponding days and weekdays.

4. Navigation: The user can navigate through months and years, allowing them to move forward or backward to view different calendars.

A simple example of a C calendar program may look like this:
This code provides a basic calendar program that displays the entire calendar for a given year, allowing users to visualize the months and their corresponding days. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and lacks advanced features like event handling, GUI, or date validations. More sophisticated calendar applications can be developed by adding additional functionalities as needed.
